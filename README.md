## Project Description
With the recent popularity increase of golf, new technologies have arrived in college golf too. Trackman technology is a dual radar system that captures the trajectory and flight of the ball, as well as the swing path of the golfer. The parameters include ball speed, attack angle, club path, face angle, and spin rate among others. This technology gives instant feedback on each shot, helping players and coaches make data-driven decisions to improve training and strategy.
- **Using this technology, how can Elon Golf improve its performance?**:
Worsley Golf Training Center, (Elon Golf Facility) has two Trackman radars, where players from both Men’s and Women’s players hit and record their shots in their daily practices. There are more than 70,000 shots recorded between 2022 and 2024 in one single trackman radar. Taking in consideration the investment made to have this technology, a correct use of it should not only give immediate detailed feedback but also provide a more data-driven approach to the team practice schedule and routine.
