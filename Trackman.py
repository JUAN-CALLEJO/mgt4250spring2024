This means that players that hit the ball shorter, hitting the ball higher in the face will optimize their distance by increasing the smash factor and ball speed.")

In the 100 yd shots, Ollie Rotermund, Matt Doyle and Juan Callejo seem to be the most accurate, with medians right at the target line. Ollie Rotermund shows great consistency with a narrow box, while Jennings Glenn and Pedro Rabadan exhibit the most variability in their shot distances. Jack Wieler and Timmy Gannon have tendencies to overshoot the target, while Juan Callejo, Garret and Matt Doyle tend to undershoot bu are accurate in this shot.  Working in distance control is crucial to shoot good rounds, therefore having control of the carry distance is key. Players should consistently work in different distances to know their game and trend dispersion to adjust decisions on the course.")
